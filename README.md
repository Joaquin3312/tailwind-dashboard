## Description

This is one of my first projects built with **Tailwind CSS**, focusing on core concepts like a **fully responsive design**, **custom color palettes**, and leveraging the power of Tailwind's utility classes to create clean, modern interfaces.

This dashboard serves as a solid foundation for future projects, showcasing how to customize and structure layouts using Tailwind CSS v4.
